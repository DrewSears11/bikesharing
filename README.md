#1. Overview of the statistical analysis
	
-The purpose of this analsyis was to help our friend use data from New York's city bike sharing and see if we can draw some conclusions
 that would give us the best chance for success to launch the same business model in Des Moines, Iowa.

#2. Results
	
- As you can see from the Table story (link up) the first graph shows the length of time each bike was checked out per ride.  You can see
  the most common time a bike was checked out was between 3 and 7 minutes.
	  
- The second graph shows the same graph but specifies by gender.  You can see the lenght is generally the same but there is about twice as
   many male riders and female riders
	  
- The third graph shows the number of bike trips by weekday and by time.  You can see Thursday tended to be the most popular day and that
   before work (7-9 AM) and after work (5-7 PM) where the most popular times of day.
	  
- The fourth graph shows the same as the graph prior but deciphers by gender.  We can draw the same conclusions, including the more males
  ride than females.  
	  
- The fifth graph deciphers by user type (subscriber or customer) and includes gender and day of the week again.  You can see that most 
  males are subscribers while within the female group it is not so defined.
	  
- The last two graphs show the most popular starting and ending locations in New York City.  There is not a lot of difference in these two
  graphs.  We can conclude that the average user didn't travel very far.  Also the first graph which showed the average ride being fairly
   low (between 3 and 7 minutes)also backs this up.

#3. Summary
	
- Based off of what we learned we can conclude that for our start up in Iowa, the best time to do maintenance on the bikes would be during
  the off hours which is extremely early in the morning.  We can see the average ride isn't very far as well, so we should concentrate 
  most of the bikes in places with a heavier population.  In the future, we could consider an analysis of pulling the weather for the days
  we have shown.  Furthermore, we could consider adding gender to the starting and stopping locations as well.  This could show if that had
  an affect on where bikes we used.
